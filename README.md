### Railway_Reservation_System_C plusplus_Binary_Search_Tree

This project is all about developing the railway reservation system that is implemeted using C++ language that includes the concept of Binary Search Tree and File handling.

**Algorithm**
1. Start
2. Include the suitable header files. 
3. Declare a structure with two pointers for left and right child. 
4. Create suitable classes and create objects in the main function to call them. 
5. Declare the necessary functions. 
6. Consider passengers as root node and pnr number as its child. 
7. Under it all other journey details will be its children. 
8. Get the choices from the user and log in with right credentials by providing a default password. 
9. Enter the user mode and display the train information when prompted by the user and acknowledge. 
10. Get the details from the user and print it using display(). 
11. If the element is less than root & lst is null, place it in left child, else loop it. 
12. For searching the trains, perform the search(), compare with root node. 
13. Calculate the total fare by the logic mentioned. 
14. When the tickets are booked ,will follow the normal BST deletion&rotation 
15. If the element is leaf node, delete that else link parent with child node. 
16. In order to cancel ticket, get the pnr no and delete the particular node. 
17. Finally display the ticket after the nodes are deleted by tree traversal. 
18. Create objects in the main functions to call its respective functions. 
19. Display the results and log out of it. 
20. End.
